ClayWorks ShareWare '.3d' file format:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a simple binary file format but please note: The floating point
values are Turbo Pascal real's. If this differs from your complier then
you may have to make a conversion to the numbers.

the first 3 words of the file are thus:

No_of_points (2 bytes)
No_of_joins (2 bytes)
No_of_Polygons (2 bytes)

The next block is the 'points' block which is an array of this record

Vector=
  x,y,z:pascal real
end

with 'no of points' entries.

The second block is of this record

Join
  from,to:word (2 bytes)
end

which is a reference to the points list with indexes starting from 0.
This has 'no of joins' entries.

The last block is the polygons list. The polygon structure is thus:

polygon=
  number_of_sides:byte
  point_references:array[0..3] of word (2 bytes each)
  colour:byte
  DoubleSided:boolean
end

At the moment 'number_of_sides' can not exceed a value of 4.
'point_references' refers to the point list in much the same way
as the joins do. Polygons are all closed, there will be changes to this
format.
This list has 'No_of_polygons' entries.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Future changes to this format are inevitable -I only give the format
away so that you can use the objects in your own programs.

This format will include a texture 'palette' to which references are made
by the polygons. The file will also include a Version header.
