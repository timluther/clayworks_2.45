^UBasic Editor Commands: Overview^U

Your toolbox is to the left hand side of the screen.
These tools are for drawing and modification.
Their names, from the top to bottom, left to right
are as follows:

^USelect^U
^USquare^U
^UCube^U
^USingle Vertex^U
^USketch Polygon^U
^UCone^U
^UCircle^U
^UCylinder^U
^USphere^U
^URotated form (lathe)^U
^UGrid^U
^UText^U

Note that you can also select these via the
'draw' menu.

Below them are several tools that are mostly to do
with display, their names are as follows:

^UZoom out^U
^UZoom in^U
^UUndo^U
^UGrid lock on/off^U
^UView all/just selected verticies^U
^UErase object^U

Below that array of buttons, is one called ^Upoly^U
this open a dialog box that allows you to change
the colour and properties of selected polygons.

And yet further down to the bottom is the rotation
gadget that allows you to rotate the 3d view
(you can do this by clicking and draging with both
mouse buttons pressed in the 3d view as well)

At the bottom of the screen is the current x,y,z
position of the 3d cursor.

^UOther important features^U
^UThe cursor^U
Click the mouse in any of the 2d views with the
right button will reposition the 3d cursor; This
is a multipurpose device and I shall be describing
it's uses as we come to them.
^UZoom and Pan in the 2d views^U
you can pan quickly, using the mouse in the 2d views
by holding down ^bshift^b and moving the mouse.
you can zoom by holding ^bshift^b and ^bctrl^b together
and moving the mouse up and down.

^UBasic Editor Commands: Detailed Descriptions^U

^USelect^U

This tool is very important to object construction;
without selecting vertices, you can't modify the
object in anyway.
  To use the select tool, you must have already
draw a shape (see the object creation tools after
this section); To select a group of verticies, simply
drag a box over an area containing some vertices. A
red bounding box will then appear and using this
bounding box, you can stretch and move this by
clicking on the side gadgets. Clicking inside the
selection box simply moves it. If you hold down
^bshift^b after you have clicked on one of the resize
gadgets and the bounding box will resize around it's
centre.
  There is also a rotate tool; for this, click on
the button to the right of the compass arrow. You
can rotate by clicking inside the bounding box (note
the absence of any resize gadgets now) and moving
the mouse left and right. The centre of rotation is
the ^b3d cursor^b discused earlier.
  When you are draging the box to make a new selection
you can also subtract from or add to the current
selection by holding down ^Bctrl^B and ^Balt^B
respectivly.
  When you are draging a selection around, either by
stretching, moving or rotating it, you can make a
copy of that selection by clicking the right button
at the same time (you drag with the left button).
If you want to make an extrution, you can click on
the little cube icon at the top of the screen,
to the right of the translate/stretch icon and
the rotate icon and click the right button as you
would when copying. The box with the little number
in it further to the right specifies how many
copies you will create when either extruding or
copying.

^USquare^U
Simply drag a square out using the left mouse
button. The ^b3d cursor^b makes up the position
on the missing axis.

^UCube^U
Use the same method as used to draw a square

^USingle Vertex^U
This will create a single vertex with no
polygon connections at the mouse position when
the left button is clicked.

^USketch Polygon^U
To use this tool, click a starting point and then
continue clicking at various points. When you want
to accept the polygon, either click in the vacinity
of the first point for a closed polygon or press
space for an open polyline.

^UCircle^U
The method for using this function is similar to
that for the square, only the circle is drawn
from it's centre.
The number box labled 'number of segments'
controls the amount of sides the circle can have;
actually it's more of a regular polygon. It can
have from 3 to 30 points.

^UCylinder^U
Same method as above.

^UCone^U
Same method as above.

^USphere^U
Same method as above only you can have longitudanal
and lateral segment counts as well.

^URotated form (lathe)^U
This tool requires a selection of vertices to work.
It basically sweeps a form through 360 degrees around
an axis (see the x,y,z buttons to the top of the
screen). Due to a slight (and temporary) oversight,
the centre of rotation is not defined by the 3d
cursor but by the 0,0,0 axis in each direction.
As a small example, try building a torus. First,
draw a circle to the right of the central axis in
the top-left view and then select it's vertices.
Now click the 'Y' button at the top of the screen.
Voila! a torus. Note that the originally selected
points are seperate and you can (and should) drag
them out of the rotated form.
The 'number of segments' defines the amount
of sections the rotated for will have.

^UGrid^U

This creates a plainar grid. There are two number
boxes that define the amount of x and y segments
and also a drop down menu defining the mode of
creation. These modes include flat, sine wave
and heightmap. To use the height map, load a
pcx file from the 'load map' button.
The checked button merely alternates the colours
on the grid between the background colour and the
foreground colour (defined in the 'poly' dialog,
see later)

^UText^U
You will need to load in a borland ^b.chr^b vector
font. Type what you want in the text box at the top
of the screen and then click in one on the 2d windows
to paste it. Be warned, this eats up vertices and you
can only have so many in the 16bit versions of
claywork

^UZoom in/out^U
Zoom in and out of the 2d views. + and - have the
same effect.

^UGridlock on/off^U
Switches the gridlock feature on or off. This is
not perfect by anymeans. The grid should be a lot
more accurate but it's the best you'll get in this
version.

^UUndo^U
This undo feature is not perfect either, be warned
that if you have solid polygons displayed in the 3d
view then this feature will misbehave; so keep it
wireframe when using it.

^UView all/just selected verticies^U
If this is one then only the selected vertices will
be shown; you can not drag them about if they are not
visible so this has some uses and makes the display
easier to see.

^UErase object^U
Does just that.

^UPoly/Material Dialog box^U

This dialog box allows you to change the colour and
attributes of the selected polygons (a selected
polygon is one whose vertices are all selected)
You can set the polygon type to be double sided,
outlined (not filled) absolute (the colour is not
shaded; you cannot see the difference in this version
of clayworks as it's only 16 colour) and smooth
shaded which applies gouraud shading.

The colour can be selected from a paltry 16 colour
palette. 24bit colour will come soon, with the 32bit
version.


^UMenu commands^U
^UMenu: File^U

^UNew^U
Creates a new object, destroys anything that's already
in memory

^ULoad^U
Allows you to load in a variety of 3d formats, some of
them are not implemented in this version (general rule:
all the useful ones that you would want, sorry about
that)

^USave^U
This will save the object, all formats listed are
supported currently.

^UAppend^U
Loads in a new object and appends to the current one.

^UExit^U
Leave the program

^UMenu: Select^U

^USticky Mouse^U
When drawing, selecting or whatever the program will
recognise a click-drag as well as a click-move-click.
experiment with it, see which feels most natural to you.

^UShow all nodes^U
Same function as the icon to the left of the screen.

^USelect All^U
Selects all the points in the object

^UCopy^U
Copy the current selection and offsets it slightly

^UClear^U
Clears the current selection (does not delete points)

^UDelete^U
Deletes the current selection (polygons are vertices)

^UMerge^U
This merges the selected vertices.

^USubmenu: Flip^U
Flips the selected vertices around an axis (X,Y or Z)

^USubmenu: Polygons^U

^UQuad divide^U
Splits quads into 4 more quads

^UTriangulate^U
Turns anything that isn't a triangle into a triangle

^USplit^U
Only TWO vertices must be selected. This splits a
polygon down these two vertices.


^UFlip normals^U
Flips the order of the vertices on a polygon,
inverses it's normal, makes it points the other way.

^UAdd^U
Creates a new polygon from the selected vertex list.
Can have weird results so use wisley.

^UDelete^U
Deletes all selected polygons but ^bnot^b the selected
vertices.
