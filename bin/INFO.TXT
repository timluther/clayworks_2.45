^uNEW THINGS IN THIS VERSION^u

new to users of 2.20

1.Each drawing tool has it's own 
  tool bar that provides more 
  functions for each mode.

2. The grid function now provides
   a choice of X and Y values,
   sine wave and checkered.

new to users of 2.32

1.Nodes that are not selected 
  can  be turned off to make 
  viewing easier.

2.RenderWare (.rwx) and 3dr 
  (.geo) files can be saved but 
  not loaded, 3dr because of an 
  unfixed bug and RenderWare 
  because it's too hard!

3.The program previously named 
  '3dsmlx' is now called 
  'viewer' and  features on-line 
  help, faster and flashier 
  graphics. No support for Clay 
  defined  palettes yet but 
  that will come soon.

4.3d bounding box and cursor.

5.Holding down 'crtl' when 
  selecting  allows you to 
  select a subselection of the 
  current selection (mouthfull 
  but true) and holding down 
  'alt' allows you to append 
  the selection. Some bugs with 
  applying attributes to textures 
  when using these two features.

6.Pallete editing in RGB and 
  HSV supported.

7.Little (but anoying) Bug with 
  faulty window  selection 
  sorted (finally!)

8.Non-existant 'deform' function
  (kept on intending to code it..)
  that crashed the system has been
  removed until I _do_ code it 8^)

9.Now reports 'lack of memory' more
  accuratly, before ClayWorks wouldn't
  run even if you had 100k over the
  recomended limit.

10.More traps for errors:Lack of object
   space is reported and dealt with,
   previously objects mearly became
   fragmented.

11. On-Line help file.

12.POV save option now works fine-
   edit the camera view inside the
   file and the lights to change 
   position -User defined Lighting
   and camera viewing are on their 
   way in Clay.

New to users of 2.37

1. Various cosmetic changes -The 
    'select modes' menu is now a 
    dropdown menu and there
    are various improvments in
    apperance.

2. New Functions: Triangulate,
   QuadDivide (imperfect), 
   smooth and flat shading
   surface options (only shows
   in the viewer program and in 
   renderware).

3. Some speed and memory 
   optimiztions in the editor.

4. Nodes can be switched off/turned
   on by the 'Show all nodes' 
   function in the 'Select' menu.

5. Viewer Program has been improved-
   Better use of colour and it's a
   bit faster.

6. Palette editor now accesable 
   through the 'Window' menu as
   well as double clicking on 
   the palette box.

7. Width of 3d objects is now 
   more rational :
   'width+height / 2'

8. Can copy with 'alt-C' as well
   as clicking both buttons when
   moving a selection.

New to users of 2.41

1. 'Rotate' select mode now 
   rotates around the 3d
   cursor.

2. New  Materials dialog box 
   (replaces colour palette).

3. 'add' polygon feature -
   select some points (in the
   correct order) and then
   make a surface using them.

4. Polygons can be 'outlined' 
   instead of 'solid'.

5. Lines and Text now show in 
   polygon modes (polylines).

6. Coordinates displayed.

7. Rotated-form function now 
   changed to 'extrude-path' 
   which allows you to 'draw' 
   with a selected shape with
   the 2d constructs 'line',
   'Circle' and in the future,
   'Curve'. This function will
   also allow you to stretch 
   the selection as you
   extrude it.

^uKnown bugs(urgh)^u

1.Don't use the undo function
  when the 3d viewer is in
  any polygon mode (hidden
  lines, depth cued, light
  sourced or gouraud) because
  it will cock up a bit.
  Silly little problem that I
  will solve soon.


2.The gouraud mode doesn't look 
  like smooth shading -I haven't
  completed the vertex smoothing
  routine (probably means bugger
  all but that's the reason).
  It ^bis^b  gouraud shading though
  it's just the colours, are all 
  wrong...

3.Quad divide is not yet perfected -
  Objects may exhibit duplication of
  nodes and lines.
