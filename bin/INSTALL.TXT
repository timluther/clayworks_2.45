To install clayworks correctly you specify two environment variables in
your autoexec.bat file.

  Type edit \autoexec.bat and you should be in a position to edit the 
file in question. To avoid confusion (if you know better then ignore), 
add the following two lines to the top or bottom of the text:
(assuming ClayWorks is in the directory 'c:\clay\' -change as appropriate 
to the location on your machine)


SET TWIN_FONTDIR=c:\clay\sansf16b.fnt
SET CLAY_DIR=c:\clay

Clay's font is specified in the first line -change this to any of the 
available font files in the clay directory if you get bored with that font.
The CLAY_DIR varaible just lets clay know where it can find the '.txt' files
included in the zip file.
