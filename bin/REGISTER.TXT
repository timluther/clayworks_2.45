^uClayWorks (c) notice^u

Clayworks is free, just about.  If you make a tonne of money
out of an object you created in this package (which to be
honest is about as likely as pink elephants being elected to
run Neath council) then you can give me a huge wad of your
money as well.

Clayworks is however, my copyright and you may not sell or
modify the program at all.

The version of Clay you have here is the latest version of the
old 16bit DOS version. I am currently working on 32bit software
for both DOS and windows. Clayworks may reappear as a new
sparkling application or I may just write a game with the 3d
code I'm working on.

To keep up to date with my everchanging whims, look at

For now, there is an excelent low-cost 3d modeller available
from Themekit. This package is really quite amazing and if you
liked Clayworks, you really should give it a look at:
